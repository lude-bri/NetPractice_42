## About

This project is a general practical exercise designed to help 42 students discover networking.

# 1. Networking

A computer network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources (like files, printers, or internet access). These devices—computers, servers, routers, switches—communicate using specific rules called protocols.

The main goal of a network is to enable communication between systems. It can range from a simple local area network (LAN) in a home to the vast global network known as the Internet.

# 2. Communication Protocols 

Protocols define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received. Without protocols, devices wouldn't understand each other. The most common reference models are the OSI Model and the TCP/IP Model.

# 2.1. OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven layers:

1. **Physical** – transmission of raw data (e.g., cables, voltages)

2. **Data Link** – error detection/correction, MAC addressing (e.g., Ethernet)

3. **Network** – routing, IP addressing (e.g., IPv4/IPv6)

4. **Transport** – reliable data transfer (e.g., TCP, UDP)

5. **Session** – managing sessions between devices

6. **Presentation** – data formatting, encryption (e.g., JPEG, SSL)

7. **Application** – user-facing software (e.g., HTTP, FTP)

> Each layer serves the one above it and is served by the one below.

# 2.1. TCP/IP

The TCP/IP model is a simplified version of the OSI model used in real-world networking. It has four layers:

1. **Network Access (Link Layer)** – combines OSI layers 1 & 2

2. **Internet Layer** – corresponds to OSI's Network Layer (IP)

3. **Transport Layer** – same as OSI (TCP/UDP)

4. **Application Layer** – combines OSI layers 5-7

> The TCP/IP model is the foundation of the modern Internet.

# 3. TCP/IP Addressing

# 3.1. Internet Addresses (IP)

An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device on a network. It serves two purposes:

* **Identification:** identifying the host or network interface

* **Location Addressing:** providing the location of the device in the network

> [!IMPORTANT]
> IPv4 addresses are written in the format: 192.168.1.1, where each number ranges from 0 to 255 (32-bit).
> IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal and are much longer (128-bit).
