# 1. Networking

A computer network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources (like files, printers, or internet access). These devices—computers, servers, routers, switches—communicate using specific rules called protocols.

The main goal of a network is to enable communication between systems. It can range from a simple local area network (LAN) in a home to the vast global network known as the Internet.

# 2. Communication Protocols 

# 2.1. OSI Model

# 2.1. TCP/IP

# 3. TCP/IP Addressing

# 3.1. Internet Addresses (IP)

# 3.2. Subnetwork
